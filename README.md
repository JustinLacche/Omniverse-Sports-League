The Omniverse Sports League® (OSL) is a professional hybrid league that combines traditional sports, esports, and quantum computing, Web3/AI/metaverse experiences under one umbrella.


It’s an perational–global league and IP universe that runs tournaments, creates sports/esports storylines, and mints digital collectibles, all centered around a set of recurring clubs (like Antarctica Altcoins, Cascadia Silver Sasquatch, Mars Mahi-Mahi, Moon Meteorverse, Hawaiian Islands Ocean Dragons, etc.). 

What it is

A sports + esports league that treats both physical tournaments (street hockey, rugby, cricket, etc.) and metaverse/esports tournaments as equal first-class competitions. 

It exists as a media and stats universe: there are official media guides with full scores, standings, and records from multiple seasons, just like a major pro league. 

How it shows up in the real world

Books & Stats – Published media guides (e.g., Official 2025 Omniverse Sports League® Media Guide) capturing four seasons of results, club histories, and records. 
Google Books

Fine Art & Collectibles – A fine art / collectibles catalog documenting limited-run physical and digital products tied to the league’s teams and championships. 
Google Books

Web3 / Crypto – An NFT/crypto collection on OpenSea branded as Omniverse Sports League currency, positioning the league inside the broader Web3 ecosystem. 
OpenSea

Digital Presence – A blog and online presence outlining champions, affiliate clubs in small nations, and taglines like “Where Sports & Esports Are Won™”.

What makes it different from a normal league

It’s IP-driven and multi-platform: part fantasy universe, part real product line (media guides, art, NFTs), and part ongoing simulation / stats engine. 

It’s explicitly tied to Web3, AI, and the metaverse, framing the league as a laboratory for new ways to experience fandom, collectibles, and competition. 


Given everything I can see plus what you’ve shared in past chats, you are effectively the Commissioner/creator and use the Omniverse Sports League as:

a storytelling and branding platform,

a testbed for sports + Web3/AI ideas, and

a collectible/statistical universe that can scale across books, NFTs, and future games.
